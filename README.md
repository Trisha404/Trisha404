<h4> I'm Trisha, I have a Bachelors's of Honours degree in psychology and did my postgrad in research, education and management ðŸŽ“ I'm a passionate about learning new things especially in relation to all things digital. I want to combine my knowledge of psychology and digital skills to change the face of mental health care in a positve mannor.
